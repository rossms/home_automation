    <h2>Prototype Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>Below are the 22 home automation designs we had originally brainstormed, but deemed not right for a low-fidelity
        prototype. This decision was made with following justifications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Too minor an interaction (task) to fully prototype</li>
        <li>Task had a primary reliance on a sensor I/O interaction rather than a human I/O interaction</li>
        <li>Task was not feasible to create testable prototypes</li>
    </ul>

            <td>Lights On/off for whole house and room. The idea here is to group each light by room, which allows whole rooms to be turned on/off at once. However, individual lights can be added to a grouping (burglar deterrent one light on in each room).
                <b>Why not selected?:</b> This was similar to the fan control design that was one of the 3 chosen.</td>
