    <h2>Design Summary</h2>
    <p>In the third iteration of this project, Team 1 continues to evolve the design and prototypes for home automation
        applications. Team 1’s project resides in the design space for using data and technology solutions based on IoT
        devices to maximize the possibilities of a “smart home.” This project has gone through various phases of analysis
        and data gathering to produce requirements that support the design activities intending to maximize the benefits of
        home automation by integrating common consumer appliances, entertainment systems, and home décor into a centralized
        interface that provides real-time analytics and a more efficient way for economic management. The results of this
        effort provide a number benefits to the average middle-class consumer, that has Internet connectivity located in
        any metropolitan cities within the United States. The <b><u>key requirements</u></b> driving functionality for this prototype
        remain and serve as the success criteria for measurement of this effort.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product design must integrate multiple common household activities reducing the need for them to be performed individually.</li>
        <li>Product design must incorporate economic and social factors introduced by the user groups.</li>
        <li>Product design must simplify a task by reducing the number of steps and effort needed to accomplish it.</li>
        <li>Product design results in energy/cost savings for the end user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This final report provides a summary of the prototyped application and documented tasks performed to influence functionality and usability of the application.
    </p>
    <h2>Additional Design Considerations</h2>
    <p>Digital consumers are bombarded daily with new technology, most making claims that they will 'simplify' the user's life or
    bring a new entertainment value. Too often however, these new technologies focus on that second aspect, creating flashy designs
    used to lure customers in, with a confusing and difficult user experience under the covers. When we originally had the
    idea to create a home automation system, we wanted to uphold that claim of simplifying a user's life, but with the ability
    to follow through with a simple user interface on the backend. </p>
    <p>We took design inspiration from the existing mobile application systems we have used, trying to keep a simple flow from
    one screen to another. By limiting content on the screens, we hoped to not overwhelm users with the system.</p>
    <p>The design considerations we took into account for future expansion was to create a modular home automation system.
    Each area of functionality is fairly independent of others, and therefore can be added an removed easily for the
    individual user's needs and requirements.</p>
    <h3>Phase 3 Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Our process followed roughly the same flow as in previous phases. Since we each have often significantly different
        daily schedules and reside in different time zones, asynchronous communication via the group discussion board proved
        the best means of keeping up with each other's progress. We again used Google Docs as our primary collaboration tool
        for authoring and editing documents.  The prototypes were built in Intellij and versioned controlled in Github.
        We decided to implement all three of the design ideas from phase 2 as well as a home screen which linked each of the
        three components.  This was sensible since as we discovered in phase 2, there was little overlap in their functionality,
        and each presented unique aspects in their structure.<br/>
        The prototype itself was composed in HTML and Javascript using the boilerplate HTML5 template, as well as libraries
        such as Chart.js and weareoutman.clockpicker.js. There were two primary iterations of the design which each of the
        three authors reviewed prior to them being presented to evaluators for review.  The first version was to transform
        the phase 2 low-fidelity prototype into a working webpage. After being evaluated internally, version two of the
        prototype was created to add more visuals and improve the flow. The version of the prototype evaluated mimicked a
        smartphone/tablet form-factor interface but was evaluated on PCs using mouse and keyboard as input.  The evaluations
        took place independently of one another so the evaluators did not collaborate evaluation nor did they meet with one
        another after it was completed.  Each reported similar experiences and, thankfully, did not find any major errors.
        The comment related to the fan page most likely was due to a “blueprint-style” view that was not realized in the
        final iteration of the phase 3 prototype.<br/>
        Our overall feedback from evaluators was positive indicating that we are on the right track and provides important
        information as we move forward.  Future iterations of the interface could be tested and evaluated using touch screen
        input as this is the more likely target device form-factor for the design.  Our success metric of economic savings
        for the end user will be difficult or impossible to directly measure via evaluations of the prototype so we will
        perhaps need to be a little creative in how we rank this criterion.
