    <h2>Evaluation Plan</h2>
    <p>The evaluation plan looks to meet all the requirements defined in early phases. Subjects representing each persona
        will be selected as evaluators. An evaluation form will be provided to collect information (negative or positive)
        for all subjects designated to evaluate the prototype. Information collected will be used as direct feedback on
        improvements or areas needing to be corrected. The following requirements define the success criteria for all
        subjects performing evaluations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product design must integrate multiple common household activities reducing the need for them to be performed individually.</li>
        <li>Product design must incorporate economic and social factors introduced by the user groups.</li>
        <li>Product design must simplify a task by reducing the number of steps and effort needed to accomplish it.</li>
        <li>Product design results in energy/cost savings for the end user.</li>
    </ul>
